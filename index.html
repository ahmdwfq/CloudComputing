          <h2>Cloud Computing</h2>
          <p class="lead">The term cloud computing refers to information being stored in the "cloud", accessed remotely via the Internet. In itself, cloud computing is not 
            a solution on its own, but enables the  implementation of other solution that once required heavy computing power. </p>
            
          <p class="lead">Cloud computing offers a platform for users to store and process vast amount of data on remote servers. It enables organisations to use computer
            resource without having to develop a computing infrastructure on premise.</p>

          <p class="lead">The capability of cloud computing to provide scalable computing resources and storage space enables companies to capture and apply business 
            intelligence through the use of big data analytics, helping them to consolidate and streamline manufacturing and business operations.</p>

          <h2>Types of Cloud Computing Services</h2><br>
          <h4>IaaS (Infrastructure as Service)</h4>
          <p class="lead">The most common service model of cloud computing as it offers the fundamental infrastructure of virtual servers, network, operating systems and data 
            storage drives. It allows for the flexibility, reliability and scalability that many businesses seek with the cloud, and removes the need for hardware in the office.</p><br>
          
          <h4>PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service)</h4>
          <p class="lead">This is where cloud computing providers deploy the infrastructure and software framework, but businesses can develop and run their own applications. 
            Web applications can be created quickly and easily via PaaS, and the service is flexible and robust enough to support them. PaaS solutions are scalable and ideal 
            for business environments where multiple developers are working on a single project. It is also handy for situations where an existing data source (such as CRM tool) 
            needs to be leveraged.</p><br>

          <h4>SaaS (Software as a Service)</h4>
          <p class="lead">This cloud computing solution involves the deployment of software over the internet to variousbusinesses who pay via subscription or a pay-per-use model. 
            It is a valuable tool for CRM and for applications that need a lot of web or mobile access – such as mobile sales management software. SaaS is managed from a central 
            location so businesses don’t have to worry about maintaining it themselves, and is ideal for short-term projects.</p><br>

          <h2>Example of Cloud Computing</h2>
          <p class="lead">Cloud computing underpins a vast number of services. That includes consumer services like Gmail or the cloud back-up of the photos on your smartphone, 
            though to the services which allow large enterprises to host all their data and run all of their applications in the cloud. Netflix relies on cloud computing services 
            to run its its video streaming service and its other business systems too, and have a number of other organisations.</p>
          <p class="lead">Cloud computing is becoming the default option for many apps: software vendors are increasingly offering their applications as services over the internet 
            rather than standalone products as they try to switch to a subscription model. However, there is a potential downside to cloud computing, in that it can also introduce
             new costs and new risks for companies using it.</p>
